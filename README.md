# College-Management-System-Database
This project is a basic implementation of a relational database schema for a College Management System using SQL. It covers the creation of tables for students, courses, and enrollments, along with appropriate keys and relationships.

ðŸ“š Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to design a well-structured schema that demonstrates:

Student records
Courses offered by the college
Enrollment details (which student enrolled in which course)
The goal is to build a well-structured, normalized schema using SQL with clearly defined primary and foreign keys.

This project is part of my learning and internship submission, aimed at demonstrating my understanding of database design concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Domain: College Management
Entities:
Students: Stores student details
Courses: Contains course information
Enrollments: Records which students are enrolled in which courses

ðŸ’» SQL Script
```

-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE College;
USE College;

-- Create Students table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(60) UNIQUE,
    DOB DATE
);

-- Create Courses table
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Credits INT CHECK (Credits > 0)
);

-- Create Enrollments table
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
